Cancellation Performance Across Airlines\n\n    We begin by examining which airlines had the highest cancellation counts and explore the underlying causes recorded in the dataset. These are then connected to relevant real-world events—such as major weather systems—to contextualize the spikes in airline disruptions.\n\n2. Delay Performance Across Airlines\n\n    Next, we analyze average delay times from several perspectives:\n\n    - Overall delay performance by airline\n\n    - Comparisons between arrival and departure delays\n\n    - How severe delays cluster across carriers\n\n    This section highlights which airlines struggled most and whether the causes appear systemic, weather-related, or operational.\n\n3. Geographic Trends: Cancellations and Delays by State\n\n    Using a U.S. map visualization, we explore how cancellations and delays varied geographically throughout January.\n    This portion examines:\n\n    - Which states experienced the most flight cancellations\n\n    - How the percentage of flights cancelled differs from the raw totals\n\n    - The extent to which January weather patterns correlate with disruption hotspots\n\n4. Time Trends: Day-by-Day Behavior\n\n    Finally, we view cancellations and delays over the entire month, identifying:\n\n    - Days with high delays but low cancellations\n\n    - Days with high cancellations but minimal delay buildup\n\n    - Days where both metrics spiked simultaneously\n\n    This helps reveal whether disruptions were isolated events or part of broader patterns.\n\n5. Interactive Dashboard\n\n    All visualizations used in the report come from a custom Power BI dashboard embedded at the end of the site. This dashboard includes multiple pages that allow for interactive exploration beyond the static images shown in the narrative.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n1.
