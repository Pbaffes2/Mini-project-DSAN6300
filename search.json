The graph in the middle left represents delay counts different delay length categories. The table in the middle right shows average delay minutes by days of the week. The barchart on the bottom shows the average delay minutes by each airline.\n\n\n\nDelays page\n\n\nNearly one in three flights (32.8%) experienced delays in January 2025, with 177,110 delayed departures out of 539,750 total flights. The average delay of 14.09 minutes might seem modest, but multiplied across thousands of daily flights, this translates to countless missed connections, disrupted travel plans, and significant economic impact.\nInterestingly, when flights do depart early, which represents a positive passenger experience, they leave an average of just 6 minutes ahead of schedule, suggesting airlines maintain relatively tight scheduling with limited buffer time.\nThe “Delay Counts per Category” reveals that while 362,000 flights departed on time, delays show a clear pattern:\n\n84,690 flights experienced 1-15 minute delays (the largest delay category)\nSharp drop-off to 31,832 flights delayed 16-30 minutes\n28,119 flights faced 31-60 minute delays\n31,622 flights (5.8% of all flights) were delayed over one hour\n\nDelays exceeding 30-60 minutes typically cascade into missed connections and significant passenger disruption. The concentration in the 1-15 minute category suggests that operational improvements in ground handling and boarding could substantially improve system-wide performance.\nWhen Delays Peak\nMondays are worst with 17.19 minutes average delay—likely due to weekend weather carryover and business travel rush Wednesdays show best performance at just 9.68 minutes Weekends see elevated delays (Saturday: 15.92, Sunday: 17.13 minutes)\nHigh-Delay Airlines:\n\nAllegiant Air (21.69 minutes) and PSA Airlines (22.14 minutes) lead in delays\nPSA’s dual challenge: High cancellations AND longest delays suggest severe operational issues\n\nTop Performers:\n\nRepublic Airline (7.69 minutes)—less than half the industry average\nAlaska (9.93 minutes) and Southwest (9.93 minutes) demonstrate operational excellence with delays below 10 minutes\n\nThe Southwest Paradox: Cancel vs. Delay Strategy Southwest’s combination of high cancellations but low delays (9.93 minutes) reveals a possible strategic operational philosophy: cancel proactively rather than delay extensively. This contrasts with PSA and Allegiant, which appear to delay flights rather than cancel, potentially leaving passengers waiting for extended periods—arguably a worse experience than a clear cancellation with rebooking options. Key Insights\nThe 1-15 minute delay concentration indicates ground operation improvements could significantly boost on-time performance Day-of-week patterns suggest predictable capacity constraints that passengers and airlines can plan around.\nPSA Airlines’ dual challenges with both high delays and cancellations may warrant an operational review to identify systemic issues affecting performance. However, it’s worth noting that regional weather patterns likely play a significant role in these metrics, as many airlines operate heavily in specific geographic areas—winter storms in the Northeast and Midwest can disproportionately impact carriers with concentrated hub operations. This geographic concentration means that localized weather events can dramatically skew an airline’s national performance statistics. For example, PSA typically operates up and down the east coast, where snowstorms consistently hit every winter."

This rare winter weather event in the Deep South caught the region particularly unprepared, as Gulf Coast airports rarely encounter snow and ice conditions—Louisiana and Mississippi’s sustained cancellation rates above 60% reflect both the severity of the storm and the lack of winter weather infrastructure in these typically mild climates. The storm’s impact on South Carolina (41.9%) demonstrates how the system continued to disrupt air travel as it tracked along the Atlantic coast, compounding the challenges faced by airlines already dealing with displaced crews and aircraft from earlier January storms."

This means about 3% of flights were cancelled in January 2025.\nMost of the cancellations occured on Thursday and Friday. Also we see that the top cancellers for the month of January were American, PSA, Delta, and Southwest accounting for more than 60% of the cancellations, which may suggest that the hubs of those airports may have been hit with inclement weather over the month.\nOf course, most of the cancellations in the month were due to weather, however if we take a look at the bar chart showing the grouping of cancallation reason with airlines, we can see both delta and PSA had a large spike in Carrier cancellation reasons, suggesting internal issues with both Delta and PSA over the month of January. This can point to possible staffing issues or issues with the aircraft. An issue with the aircraft could have arised from the inclement weather over the course of January, as we will explore in the map visual tab."

Notably, total delay minutes peaked slightly earlier on January 5th at around 3,500 minutes, suggesting airlines initially attempted to operate through deteriorating conditions before making the decision to cancel more aggressively the following day. This pattern of delay spikes preceding cancellation spikes reflects the difficult real-time decisions airlines must make as weather conditions evolve.\nThe most severe disruption occurred during the January 9-10 storm, where cancellations exploded to nearly 3,000 flights on January 10th, the highest single-day cancellation count of the month. This peak aligns with the 80.7% cancellation rate observed in Georgia, home to the nation’s busiest airport in Atlanta. The Gulf Coast blizzard on January 21-22 produced a more sustained disruption pattern, with elevated cancellations across both days (approximately 1,500-1,700 flights) rather than a single dramatic spike, reflecting Louisiana and Mississippi’s complete shutdown over the extended period. Between these major events, the system demonstrates strong resilience, quickly returning to baseline levels of 100-200 daily cancellations and minimal delays, though each successive storm likely compounded operational challenges through crew and aircraft displacement."
